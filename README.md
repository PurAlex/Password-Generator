# Password-Generator

## Description

This is a password generator where the user can choose the length of the password and choose what options they want, the options are special characters, numeric characters, lower case and upper case characters. 

I found this project challenging and enjoyable. The challenge that I encounter was with functions and how to return the generated password to display on the HTML. 

With this project I have more knowledge on Javascript and how it can be implemented on a website.
